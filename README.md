# Round-Robin-Schedule-Simulator
The Round Robin scheduling algorithm is a widely used algorithm in computer science and operating systems for managing the execution of processes or tasks in a multitasking or time-sharing environment. It is a simple and fair scheduling algorithm that allocates CPU time to multiple processes in a round-robin fashion, ensuring that each process gets a fair share of the CPU's time.
This software emulates this behavior and presents it with a GUI to simulate all state changes; as well as allowing user to change processes parameters.
